* Good use of `engines` in package.json.
    * It might be worth considering whether `< 9` is still appropriate, but
    it made it immediately obvious which version of `node` I should be using!
* `npm run start` worked straight away (well... after `yarn`)... thanks!

* You might want to looking into `prop-typs`. It lets you define the
  expected properties for a component and their expected types... it also
  makes it easier to define default properties
